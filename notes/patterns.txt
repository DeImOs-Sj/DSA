Mostly patterns consist of nested loops !!
The patterns consist of inner loops and outer loops.Inner loops is for (Columns) and the Outer loop is for the (rows).
Main points to remember:
1)For the outer loops,count the no.of lines,no. of rows
2)for the inner loop , focus on the columns & connect them somehow to the rows
3)Print them `*` inside the inner for loop
